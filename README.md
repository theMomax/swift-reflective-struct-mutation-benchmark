# swift-reflective-struct-mutation-benchmark

This benchmark compares different methods to inject a struct's properties with values. Even though some of the solution are applicable in different contexts, this benchmark was designed to reflect the needs of the [Apodini](https://github.com/Apodini/Apodini) framework.

Refer to the main.swift file for more details and documentation.
